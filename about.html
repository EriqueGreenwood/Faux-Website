                Christian Friedrich Johannes Büttner (born: June 1, 1979 [age 42]), 
                better known by his stage name TheFatRat is a German YouTube DJ, 
                record producer and musician who makes Dance and Electronic music. 
                Most of his music is available for free on Soundcloud. Büttner started playing the flute when he was four, and he began playing the piano at six.
                His original career was a conductor, which he quit from later on as it was too uncreative, and he began to create music in 2001. At first,
                 his only works were for background music on TV, radio and adverts and for ringtones, or were made for other artists and DJs.
                  Then, under the name TheFatRat, he began releasing remixes and, from 2013, intensified his music.

                From here on out ignore this text I needed to just fill space.
                Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.
                In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.
                Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid.
                It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.
